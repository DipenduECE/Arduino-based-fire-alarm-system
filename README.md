# Arduino-based-fire-alarm-system
One of the preventive measures to avoid the danger is to install an automatic fire alarm detector at vulnerable locations, hence the Arduino based fire alarm detection and control system is proposed. It is capable of automatically detecting temperature and gas concentration in a given environment, sound an alarm, switch on LEDs for fire indication, display warning message in a LCD screen and also turn on a fan to reduce the intensity of fire. The system uses a LM35 temperature sensor along with a gas sensor for temperature and smoke detection, a buzzer for producing alarming sound, a series of LEDs for visualization purpose, a LCD screen 16X2 for display purpose, and a DC motor that can be attached with a fan to cool the system in case of fire, and Atmeg328p Microcontroller.
